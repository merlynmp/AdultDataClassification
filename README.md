Hello! This is a Machine Learning project that I wanted to indulge in

Using 1994 data from the US Census, I wanted to classify between gender

I cleaned the dataset with Numpy and Pandas

Created visualizations with Seaborn and Matplotlib

Utilized Scikit learn to build the models. 

Explored various algorithms such as Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Classifier.
